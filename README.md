# Pi Art

![](pi.png)

This project contains a series of python scripts that use the data of Pi as a source for PNG files. 

I had the idea for this project while talking with a friend about the infinite possibilities of the data in Pi.
Somewhere in Pi, there's an entire friend's episode script, or an eminem song that hasn't been written, or the text
on a scroll that was lost in the fire at the library of Alexandria. 

While the highest calculation of Pi is currently at 22 trillion decimal places, the chances one of those things above
exists in what we've calculated are quite slim. It is possible, however, that an 8x8 sprite from a retro game is
somewhere in that data. Who knows?

## Pi

I used [this site](https://pi2e.ch/blog/2017/03/10/pi-digits-download/#download) for the values of Pi. 
Also, I use the hexidecimal representation to reduce massaging. (If you don't use the hex version and opt for the 
decimal, the colors won't cover the full spectrum)
